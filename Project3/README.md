# FYS5555
Project 3 in research-based particle physics.

## To run the Jupyter notebook you need following packages: 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Xgboost

All of these can be easily installed by pip or conda. If you run following lines in your terminal you should be fine:

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install xgboost

If you prefer conda you can run the same lines but replacing pip with conda.
